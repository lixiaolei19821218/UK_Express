<p>2.3 We warrant that the Service(s) will be provided using reasonable care and skill.</p>
<p>3.<strong>Loading and Unloading</strong></p>

<p>3.2 Any Consignment (or part of a Consignment) requiring any special equipment for loading and unloading shall be accepted by us for transportation only on the understanding and condition that such special equipment will be made available at the Collection Point and the Delivery Point as required.Where such equipment is not available and if we agree to load or unload the Consignment (or part of the Consignment) we shall be under no liability or obligation of any kind to you for any damage caused (however it may be caused) during the loading or unloading of the Consignment.This includes any damage caused whether or not by our negligence and you shall agree to indemnify and hold us harmless against any claim or demand from any person arising out of our agreeing to load or unload the Consignment in these circumstances.</p>
<p>4.<strong>Collection and Deliveries</strong></p>
<p>4.1 We will make one attempt to deliver a Consignment during normal working hours. If we cannot obtain a delivery receipt at the Delivery Point you agree that we shall be authorised to attempt to deliver the Consignment to, or obtain a delivery receipt from, an alternative address close to the Delivery Point and (if successful) we agree that we will leave at the Delivery Point details of the address to which we have delivered the Consignment. If we are unable to deliver, either to the Delivery Point or a nearby address, we shall return the Consignment to our premises and leave a request for the recipient of the Consignment to contact us to make alternative delivery arrangements to the Delivery Point.If the recipient does not contact us to arrange the alternative delivery within&nbsp;<strong>7 days&nbsp;</strong>we will return the Consignment to you at your cost (such cost to be discharged before delivery to you).</p>
<p>4.2 If we consider that the Consignment has become a Damaged Consignment and cannot be delivered because it is or in our reasonable opinion is likely to be unsafe hazardous or harmful we reserve the right to dispose of the Damaged Consignment immediately. If the Consignment becomes a Damaged Consignment because of our actions and we have to dispose of it we will only be liable to you up to the amounts specified in 6.7.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Sub-Contractors</strong></p>
<p>5.1 You agree that we may use another carrier in order to support our provision of the services to you (this will be at our own expense) and you agree that both we and this other carrier shall be entitled to the protection of all of the terms of this Agreement which exclude or limit liability for any losses or damage.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>Our Liability</strong></p>
<p><strong>YOUR ATTENTION IS DRAWN PARTICULARLY TO THIS CLAUSE AND THE LIMITS OF OUR LIABILITY WITHIN IT.</strong></p>
<p>6.1 Where you deal with us as a consumer, nothing within these terms and conditions shall be deemed to affect your rights under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. For the avoidance of any doubt, when you deal with us as a business the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 is hereby excluded to the fullest extent legally possible and you are further referred to additional terms relating to business clients set out below.</p>
<p>6.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude our liability for:</p>
<p>(a) death or personal injury caused by our negligence;</p>
<p>(b) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.</p>
<p>6.3 As a responsible business, we will perform the Service(s) in a professional manner with the appropriate level of skill and care.However, damage to a Consignment may still occur as a consequence of our handling of it and in such circumstances, our liability shall be limited as set out in these it terms and conditions. The reasoning behind this limitation of our liability is as follows:</p>
<p>(a) The value of a Consignment and the amount of potential loss to you that could arise if a Consignment is damaged or lost is not something which we can easily ascertain but is something which is better known to you.In many cases it cannot be known to us at all and can only be known to you;</p>
<p>(b) The potential amount of loss that might be caused or alleged to be caused to you is likely to be disproportionate to the sum that we could reasonably be expected to charge you for providing the Service(s) under this Agreement;</p>
<p>(c) It is not possible for us to obtain cover which would give unlimited compensation for our full potential liability to all of our customers and, even if it were, such cover would be much cheaper if taken out by you (rather than us taking out such cover and passing the cost on to you) and on that basis, it is more appropriate for you to take out such cover;</p>
<p>(d) We wish to keep the costs of providing the Service(s) to you as low as possible;</p>
<p>(e) In light of the above we wish to limit our liability for any damage caused to you to levels which we consider proportionate to our low charges for providing the Services. These amounts are set out in clause 6.5;</p>
<p>(f) &nbsp; In these Terms and Conditions, damage to you means any damage suffered by you (including any loss of, or damage to, a Consignment and any other loss, whether or not known to you or us or in either of our contemplation at the time of entering into this Agreement), however it arises but only so long as it is caused by our negligence, breach of duty or other wrongful act or omission (which includes any deliberately wrongful act or omission) and any breach of any the terms of this Agreement, or any terms implied by statute (where applicable);</p>
<p>(g) We investigate all claims received by us in a fair and speedy manner, but such investigations are more accurate and are easier to perform soon after the loss or damage is alleged to have incurred and on that basis, the timescales set out in this Agreement are necessary to ensure that such investigations can be performed fairly.</p>
<p><em>The Extent of our Liability</em></p>
<p>6.4&nbsp;<strong>We shall only be liable for damage or loss caused to you if it is caused by our negligence, breach of duty or other wrongful act or omission, and only subject to the limitations set out within this clause 6 and clause 7;</strong></p>
<p>6.5&nbsp;<strong>We shall not be liable to you under any circumstances for any direct or indirect loss (including, but not limited to loss of profits, or loss of goodwill) or for any other special or indirect losses, costs, damages, or claims which do not arise naturally as a result of our negligence, breach of duty, or other wrongful act or omission.</strong></p>
<p>6.6&nbsp;<strong>We shall not be liable to you under any circumstances where there are any material discrepancies (meaning more than 10% difference) between the declared dimensions and weights and the actual dimensions and weights.</strong></p>
<p><em>The Limitation on the Amount of our Liability</em></p>
<p>6.7 If we are liable to you for any reason, we shall (subject always to clause 7) only be liable to you up to the following amounts in the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>If we lose or damage all of a Consignment</strong>&nbsp;we will be liable for a maximum of &pound;50. If however this maximum figure is greater than the actual value of the Consignment then we shall only be liable for the full value of that Consignment;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;<strong>If we lose or damage part of a Consignment</strong>, the amount of the sum determined under clause 6.7(a) above shall be pro rated down to represent the proportion that the actual value of that part of the Consignment bears to the actual value of the whole Consignment (so, by way of an illustrative example, if the whole Consignment was worth &pound;50 , and we lost or damaged one quarter of it, we would only be liable for 25% of the figure worked out under clause 6.7(a) above, i.e. &pound;12.50 for the &pound;50 service);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;<strong>If we cause you loss or damage arising in any other way</strong>, a maximum of &pound;50 in respect of any Consignment.</p>
<p>If you consider that the potential loss to you caused by the loss or damage of all (or part) of a Consignment would exceed the figures set out above you&nbsp;<strong>must</strong>&nbsp;arrange separate cover or insurance to cover such potential loss.If you do not do this then we shall not be liable to you for more than the amounts set out above and you shall be responsible for the risks in any amounts not covered through such cover or insurance (or lack of).</p>
<p>We will not be liable to repay you the value of the Consignment as at the time it was purchased by you. Consignments by their nature are subject to depreciation. You are advised to take out a &ldquo;new for old&rdquo; insurance policy should you wish to be compensated in this way. Our liability to you is limited to the amounts set out within this clause 6 and based on the actual value at the date of loss.</p>
<p>6.8 In order to ascertain the extent of our liability above, we shall require proof of the value and weight of the entire Consignment and any part or parts of it which make it up and you must ensure that, prior to our collection of the Consignment, you have a record of these. For the avoidance of any doubt, and without affecting clause 6.5, we shall only be liable for the replacement value of the Consignment and not for any sums that would amount to profit on the Consignment or applicable value added tax (or like tax) on such profit.</p>
<p>6.9 If a claim arises as a result of damage to the whole or part of a Consignment and if we settle the claim for a sum equal to or greater than the value of the Consignment, then we shall be entitled to claim ownership of the Consignment and deal with it as we see fit.&lt; For the avoidance of any doubt, we shall be responsible for the cost of recovery of the Consignment.</p>
<p>6.10 If you wish to combine a number of discrete packages you must do this within an outer box or packaging fully encompassing each discrete package. If you do not do this and any individual discrete package(s) come apart in transit resulting in one or more of them being lost, then once the remaining parcel(s) are signed for by the recipient, you accept that you cannot make a claim for loss or partial loss of that consignment.</p>
<p><em>Notification of Claims</em></p>
<p>6.11 We shall not be liable to you under any circumstances for any loss or damage unless you notify us either by email to us within:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;<strong>14 days</strong>&nbsp;of delivery of the Consignment in the case of damage to all or part of a Consignment or loss of part of a Consignment;</p>
<p>(b) and in all other cases (including, but not limited to, loss of the whole of a Consignment) within&nbsp;<strong>28 days</strong>from when the Consignment was collected or received by us.</p>
<p><em>Refunds</em></p>
<p>6.12 All requests for refunds must be submitted in writing to JRD Ltd, Unit 6,&nbsp;Marlets Trading Estate,&nbsp;Marlets Way,&nbsp;Worthing,&nbsp;BN12 4HF&nbsp;and received by us within 28 days from the date the Service was Purchased.</p>
<p><em>Special Provisions</em></p>
<p>6.13 (a) We shall not, in any circumstances, be liable to you for any damage caused arising directly or indirectly as a result of any of the Excepted Risks.</p>
<p>(b) If at any time we are prevented or delayed from starting, carrying out or completing any of the Services because of a strike, lock out, labour dispute, weather conditions, traffic congestion, mechanical breakdown or obstruction of any public or private road or highway or any other cause beyond our control, you shall have no claim for damages against us for any loss that you may suffer as a result PROVIDED that, where the delay is caused by the mechanical breakdown of one of our vehicles, we shall use our best endeavors to provide a replacement vehicle with the minimum delay practicable.</p>
<p>(c) We shall not in any circumstances be liable for any late delivery or missed delivery or failure to deliver caused by or contributed to by any deficient or ambiguous labelling of a Consignment and you agree to be responsible for ensuring that such labelling is clear and unambiguous.</p>
<p><em>Your Default</em></p>
<p>6.14 If our performance of any of our obligations under this Agreement is prevented or delayed by any act or omission by you or failure by you to perform any relevant obligation (&ldquo;<strong>Your Default</strong>&rdquo;):</p>
<p>(a) we shall (without limiting our other rights or remedies) have the right to suspend performance of the Service(s) until you remedy Your Default and, and we shall have the right to rely on Your Default if Your Default prevents or delays our performance of any of our obligations;</p>
<p>(b) we shall not be liable for any costs or losses that you may suffer that arising directly or indirectly from our failure or delay to perform any of our obligations; and</p>
<p>(c) you shall reimburse us on written demand for any costs or losses sustained or incurred by us arising directly or indirectly from Your Default.</p>

<p>7.3 We shall not be responsible for any local customs charges, import taxes or duties or any similar charge(s) incurred through our carriage and/or delivery of any Consignment and you must satisfy yourself as to whether any of these charges will become due, and if so in what amounts, before completing an order with us. If any such charges become due as a result of our carriage and/or delivery of a Consignment on your behalf and are charged to us by any competent authority you agree to reimburse us fully in respect of the same within 7 days of our demand.</p>

<p>8.3 You agree to indemnify us against any losses or liabilities that we may suffer through a breach by you of any of your obligations set out in clause 10.</p>
